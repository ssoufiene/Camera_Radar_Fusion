This repository implements camera–radar fusion pipelines for 2D object detection. It includes:

-Training camera-only, early-fusion, and middle-fusion models

-Explicit feature alignment using cross-attention for improved radar–camera fusion

-Utilities for projecting radar points to image and BEV grids

-End-to-end training and evaluation scripts with PyTorch
